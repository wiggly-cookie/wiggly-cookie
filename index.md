Hi everyone! My IGN is Cookie (she/her), and this is my gaming blog! This blog is mainly for myself, because I enjoy documentation and reflection. Everyone is welcome to follow along on my gaming journey!

The primary game I will blog about is going to be Petit Planet, although I play an assortment of games ranging from Baldur's Gate 3 to Pokemon.
